Faketwit
========
11/23 - 

	Started working on this project to make a fake twitter, going to use this as a template later for the blog project that's due next week. 

	So far, I have the creation of the database and creation of accounts already linked up, along with the form data for the sign up, and the basic layout profile.

	For some reason, the rack-flash doesn't seem to work and gives me an error of "no method found: flash"... Which means that there's something going on with the rack-flash itself. 

	Besides that, my newest problem is the login itself. It accesses the database, yet it doesn't give me the redirect into the profile screen.
